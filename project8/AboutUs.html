<h1>About Us</h1>

<p><span class="drop">L</span>eahy’s Bees began as a small backyard hobby with two simple goals:  
to raise healthy honeybee colonies and to share the joy of beekeeping with family and friends.  
What started with a single hive quickly grew into a small but thriving apiary built on curiosity,  
careful stewardship, and a respect for the incredible work bees do every day.</p>

<h2>How We Got Started</h2>
<p>Our very first hive was a gift, placed in a sunny corner of the yard near the garden.  
After our first season — and our first taste of fresh honey — we were hooked.  
We began studying hive behavior, tracking nectar flows, and learning how different  
weather patterns affect colony growth.</p>
<p>Over time, we added more hives and expanded our skills in maintaining healthy brood,  
managing swarms, and producing clean, beautifully filtered honey.</p>

<h2>What We Do Today</h2>
<p>Today, Leahy’s Bees manages several small colonies focused on sustainable beekeeping,  
gentle hive handling, and natural honey production. We harvest only the honey our bees  
are able to spare, ensuring that every colony has everything it needs to thrive year-round.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We produce small-batch honey from local nectar sources</li>
  <li>We offer basic hive demonstrations for community groups</li>
  <li>We grow pollinator-friendly plants around each hive site</li>
  <li>We work to educate others on the importance of healthy bee populations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
<p>Healthy bees make everything possible. We avoid harsh chemicals, open hives only when  
necessary, and prioritize colony well-being above honey production. Our goal is simple:  
to support the bees that support all of us.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>We are continually learning and improving. Future plans include expanding our pollinator  
garden, experimenting with new hive designs, and offering a “hive adoption” program where  
people can support a colony throughout the year.</p>

<p>If you’re new to beekeeping, curious about honey production, or simply love watching bees  
work, we’re glad you’re here.</p>
