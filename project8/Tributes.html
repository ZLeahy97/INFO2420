<h1>Hive Tributes</h1>

<p>Every hive has its own personality. Some build fast, some stay calm and steady,
and a few become instant favorites. These short tributes highlight a few of the
colonies that have taught us the most at Leahy’s Bees.</p>

<h2>Hive 1 – The Starter Colony</h2>
<p>Hive 1 was our original “teaching hive.” It survived our early mistakes, late-night
inspections with a flashlight, and more note-taking than any colony really needed.
Despite that, it stayed gentle and productive, giving us our first real harvest of
bottled honey.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Location: back corner of the garden, near the lilacs</li>
  <li>Best trait: extremely calm temperament</li>
  <li>Most memorable moment: our very first frame fully capped with honey</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hive 2 – The Overachiever</h2>
<p>Hive 2 grew fast from day one. The queen laid strong, even patterns and the
workers filled every box we gave them. We learned how to stay ahead of swarm
pressure, add supers early, and give busy bees plenty of space to work.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Location: along the fence line near the clover patch</li>
  <li>Best trait: incredible spring buildup</li>
  <li>Most memorable moment: three honey supers filled in a single strong flow</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Hive3Tribute">Hive 3 – The Sunny-Day Workhorse</h2>
<p>Hive 3 is the colony featured in the mini tribute on our Home page. On any warm
day you’ll find a steady stream of foragers lifting off over the dandelions in front
of the hive. It isn’t the biggest or loudest colony, but it is the most consistent:
strong brood, steady honey stores, and calm behavior on the comb.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Location: edge of the field facing the morning sun</li>
  <li>Best trait: reliable, balanced growth all season</li>
  <li>Most memorable moment: powering our first single-hive bottling run</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these hives remind us that good beekeeping is really about paying
attention, working gently, and letting each colony show you what it needs.</p>
