    <h2>Pitchfork – <a href="https://pitchfork.com/">https://pitchfork.com/</a></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The first impression is that the site looks modern and clean. The dark header and large images make it feel like a magazine.</li>
      <li>The site is set up with a menu bar at the top, a big main image area, main stories in the middle, and a “Latest” section on the right.</li>
      <li>The layout makes sense and is easy to follow. Everything is clearly labeled, though ads sometimes get in the way a little.</li>
      <li>The photos and videos are sharp and make the stories more interesting. The grid layout is steady, and the review symbols help highlight key articles. Ads can be distracting but don’t take over.</li>
      <li>The page loads fairly quickly, even with all the images. Most of the main content shows up right away, with extra parts loading just after.</li>
      <li>The text is easy to read with black and white contrast, good font size, and comfortable spacing. A plain background keeps it clear.</li>
      <li>The navigation bar is simple, with clear categories, a search option, and newsletter links. Story boxes are clickable and make browsing straightforward.</li>
      <li>The same colors and fonts are used throughout the site. The black, white, and gray color scheme gives it a consistent style.</li>
      <li>The site works well on smaller screens. Columns stack, images resize, and the menu turns into a simpler format without needing to scroll sideways.</li>
      <li>The review badges and the always-updated “Latest” section stand out as useful features. The site looks polished and well put together.</li>
